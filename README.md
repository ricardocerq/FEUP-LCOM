# FEUP-LCOM
Project developed for Computer Laboratory class
Device drivers developed for timer, keyboard, mouse, RTC and serial port. Final project involved making a program that utilizes all of those drivers.
The game we made features a simple collision and physics system, self-implemented image loading, transparency, font, typing system and image-scaling techniques.
The multiplayer features a simplified chat system.
All developed in C except for keyboard interrupt handler which was written in assembly
